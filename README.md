# Nurse Patient Assignment Project Backend

Here is a link to my github repository for the frontend REACT application: https://github.com/kkelley622/phase-3-project-frontend
 
## Introduction

I built this basic web API with Sinatra and Active Record for my phase-3 project of Flatiron School software engineering flex pilot program. The function of this API is to store the data of nurses and patients of a hypothetical hospital unit. Each patient will be assigned(or belong to) a nurse, and each nurse might be assigned many patients during their shift. 

## Instructions

- Navigate to this folder's directory. (backend)
- Run 'bundle exec rake server' in the terminal. (This will launch the server on localhost:9292)
- Navigate to http://localhost:9292 in the web browser to view the API. Navigate to http://localhost:9292/nurses to view nurses data, and to http://localhost:9292/patients to view patients data.
- Interact with the REACT application and observe changes to the backend API.

## Requirements

- Ruby gems
- Active Record
- Sinatra

## Conclusion

This backend application is a simple web based API which stores data of patients and nurses on a hospital unit. We can add nurses or patients to the unit as well as discharge patients when they are able to leave the unit. We can also view and change which nurse is assigned to each patient on the unit.
